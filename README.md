# Lawrence_Data_Science
 Applications for The Lawrence around Data Science

The two examples, knn_example and pose_example, contain html and js files that can be downloaded and run locally.
They demonstrate how simple it can be to run client side inference and machine learning models.
The source code of the files is from <https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/ml5/7.1-posenet.html> and

## About the project
Data Science for all is a project being developed for the Lawerence Hall of Science. The project is undertaken to help kids of all ages learn more about data-science in a fun and interactive way! The final website will be hosted at a screen in the Lawerence Hall of Science in Berkeley.
## How we built it
We used React to build the project from scratch. We learned & implemented key concepts of ReactJS such as functional programming patterns, and class and functional components over a semester and built a beautiful and responsive website.
## Challenges I ran into
One of our team members had to leave the project in the first week of the semester. Thus, we went from a team of four to a team of three. But with our persistence and hard work, we learned fast and implemented the project faster. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The biggest accomplishment would be that apart from learning the projects. 

## What's next for Data Science for all
As of right now, only one experience, i.e., the google teachable machine has been implemented. In the future, we will add more experiences and improve the UI. We are just getting started! :D
